## Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation

This is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for an input file containing information of edges and their weight

## Functions implemented

- `addEdge`: Adds an edge to the graph
- `deleteEdge`: deletes an edge from the graph

further more funcitons to be added
